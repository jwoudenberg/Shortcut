# Shortcut

Shortcut is web-based card-laying game.
Players have to bases between which they must create a route, by drawing, placing and rotating cards.

This is a project I originally started to learn Javascript (old version sits in the master branch).
Since then I've been returning to it as a means of teaching myself new concepts.

In this altest iteration, I'm trying to rebuild in in elm-lang.

Check below for another not completed version in a further stage of development.
Place some cards and hover over paths.
